# Node Web
Practice with OpenGL ES for an upcoming app

On button press gives 3 options for creating a "node" on the GLSurfaceView (only first one implemented):
 the button creates an intent to open the camera app, and upon capturing an image, allows the placement of a small mipmap
 on the surfaceview.
 
Texture management is unjustifiably time consuming, so decided on a different approach.
